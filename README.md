# Cave-Of-Luck

![](https://github.com/angela-rodriguezz/Cave-Of-Luck/blob/main/game%20gif.gif)

A procedural world generation game in which you enter an integer as a seed and receive a new combination of rooms and hallways to explore! Each time the world is generated, the player gets new orb locations which foretell a lucky combination of lottery numbers that you can play for your town's next lottery. Play and gain a higher chance of winning this year's lottery!

Executed the world generation algorithm, UI, main menu interface, saving/loading, and user interactivity game mechanics.

## Data Structures

### Part 1: Room Generation Algorithm

I used Java's ``Tileset`` and ``StdDraw library`` to implement the room generation algorithm.
