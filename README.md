A procedural world generation game in which you enter an integer as a seed and receive a new combination of rooms and hallways to explore! Each time the world is generated, the player gets new orb locations which foretell a lucky combination of lottery numbers that you can play for your town's next lottery. Play and gain a higher chance of winning this year's lottery!
